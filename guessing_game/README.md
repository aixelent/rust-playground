### Guess the number ###
Write a program where the program chooses a number between 1 and 10. A player is then prompted to enter a guess. If the player guesses wrong,   then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct.
When the player has made a successful guess the computer will issue a "Well guessed!" message, and the program exits.
