### Binary digits ###
Classic problem in programming contests, it's given so contestants can gain familiarity with the online judging system being used. 

##### Task #####
Create and display the sequence of binary digits for a given   non-negative integer.

```
   The decimal value      5   should produce an output of               101
   The decimal value     50   should produce an output of            110010
   The decimal value   9000   should produce an output of    10001100101000
```

The results can be achieved using built-in radix functions within the language   (if these are available),   or alternatively a user defined function can be used.

The output produced should consist just of the binary digits of each number followed by a   newline.

There should be no other whitespace, radix or sign markers in the produced output, and leading zeros should not appear in the results.
